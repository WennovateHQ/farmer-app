4. **Documentation**
   - `README_AUTH.md` - Authentication system documentation
   - `migrations.md` - Migration guide for the new auth system
   - `authentication_enhancements.md` - This document

### Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**
   - User fills out registration form
   - Form is validated
   - User accepts terms & conditions
   - Account is created
   - Verification email is sent (if enabled)

2. **Email Verification**
   - User receives verification email
   - User enters verification code
   - Email is verified
   - User can proceed to login

3. **Login**
   - User enters email and password or uses Google Sign-In
   - Credentials are validated
   - JWT token is generated and stored securely
   - User is redirected to home screen

4. **Password Reset**
   - User requests password reset
   - Reset email is sent
   - User clicks link or enters reset token
   - User sets new password
   - User can login with new credentials

5. **Profile Management**
   - User views profile information
   - User can edit profile details
   - User can upload profile image
   - Changes are saved to backend

## JWT Token Management

The JWT authentication system implements:

1. **Token Format**
   - Header: Algorithm and token type
   - Payload: User ID, role, permissions, expiration
   - Signature: Verification hash

2. **Token Storage**
   - Tokens stored in encrypted storage
   - Automatic token inclusion in API requests
   - Token expiration handling

3. **Role-Based Permissions**
   - Admin: read, write, update, delete, admin
   - Farmer: read, write, update, delete_own
   - Driver: read, update_delivery
   - Consumer: read, create_order

## Testing

The authentication system includes comprehensive mock implementations for testing without a backend connection. All auth flows can be tested in isolation using these mocks.

## Recommendations for Further Enhancements

1. **Two-Factor Authentication**
   - Implement SMS or authenticator app-based 2FA

2. **Biometric Authentication**
   - Add fingerprint/face recognition support

3. **Session Management**
   - Implement token refresh mechanism
   - Add session timeout handling

4. **Social Sign-In**
   - Expand beyond Google Sign-In
   - Add Facebook, Apple, Twitter options

5. **Audit Logging**
   - Track auth events for security analysis
   - Implement suspicious activity detection
