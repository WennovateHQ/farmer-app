# Authentication System Migration Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the steps needed to migrate from the old authentication system to the new enhanced authentication system with secure storage, better state management, and improved user experience.

## Files Created/Updated

### New Files

1. `lib/shared/services/auth_service.dart` - Comprehensive authentication service using Provider pattern
2. `lib/main_updated.dart` - Updated main file with Provider setup for auth
3. `lib/screens/login_screen_updated.dart` - Enhanced login screen with animations
4. `lib/screens/register_screen_updated.dart` - Enhanced register screen with better validation
5. `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` - Home screen showing user data and navigation options
6. `README_AUTH.md` - Documentation for the authentication system

### Migration Steps

1. **Update Dependencies**:
   - Add the following dependencies to `pubspec.yaml`:
     ```yaml
     flutter_secure_storage: ^9.0.0
     page_transition: ^2.1.0
     provider: ^6.1.1
     ```

2. **Replace Main.dart**:
   - Replace the content of `lib/main.dart` with the content from `lib/main_updated.dart`

3. **Replace Screens**:
   - Replace the content of `lib/screens/login_screen.dart` with the content from `lib/screens/login_screen_updated.dart`
   - Replace the content of `lib/screens/register_screen.dart` with the content from `lib/screens/register_screen_updated.dart`

4. **Convert API Service Usage**:
   - All screens using the old `ApiService` directly should be updated to use the `AuthService` provider:
     ```dart
     final authService = Provider.of<AuthService>(context, listen: false);
     ```

5. **Update Screen References**:
   - Ensure that all navigation continues to use the route names defined in `main.dart`

## Testing

1. Test the full authentication flow:
   - Registration
   - Email verification
   - Login
   - Password reset
   - Profile management

2. Test Google Sign-In functionality

3. Verify secure token storage by checking that authentication persists across app restarts

## Fallback Plan

If any issues are encountered during migration, the following fallback options are available:

1. Use the original files as they were before the migration
2. Continue using `ApiService` directly if `AuthService` integration issues occur
3. Gradually migrate screens one at a time rather than all at once

## Authentication Flow Testing

Run the following commands to test the authentication system:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome --web-port=5000
```

## Support

For any issues during migration, refer to the Flutter documentation on:
- Provider package: https://pub.dev/packages/provider
- Secure storage: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage
